# Music Releases 🎷

In this week project we started to learn React for the very first time by building a music release site using React components which show new album and single releases by using fetched data from Spotify.

This was a pair programming project made by Jessi Nygren Walhed and Aleksandra Safranko.

# How we built it and what we learned 👩‍💻

Since it was our first time using React we had to understand basic theory how to structure a page using components and how to use props to pass data into our components.
We created a App component that contains all the other small components that represent the 'Album Card' that are generated by using map() method on array od data fetched from Spotify.
Inside the Album component by using props we generate HTML elements that will show every Album's cover image, name and artist. Name and artist link to their Spotify pages and albums.
We also implemented 'Playlist' component that displays fetched data based on ???
