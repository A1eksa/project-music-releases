# Music Releases

This week project was start of learning React building a "New Releases"music site. Goal was to practice React and creating components using data from Spotify.

## The problem

We had a challenging time creating components and then bringing them together in the mother file.If we had more time would like to practice that more.
Since it was first week of react our goal was to make small steps that we then understand well rather then to take a big bite into the project.
